# Advent of Code 2017

### Update #1: Lets do this!
### Update #2: Half way through, days 3 and 11 where especially tricky gotta put more "brainz" into solutions...
### Update #3: I was away for the weekend so I was late for days 16 and 17 challenges.. did them both today.. loved how both required insane amount of iteration but could be done in far less (looking at you day 16) :)
### Update #4: Day 20 finished, only 5 days (10 :star:) to go!! Today's challenge was kinda funny because in part 1 I over simplified solving and in part 2 I over complicated.. note to myself: First try fast and stupid then clever and correct!!
### Update #5: Day 21 -> numpy FTW!!!!
### Update #6: Merry Xmas! Done with all the puzzles, was fun, learned a lot, looking forward to the next year, I am onto cookies now! ... cheers!
