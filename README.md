# Advent of Code 2017

### Update #1: Lets do this!
### Update #2: Half way through, days 3 and 11 where especially tricky gotta put more "brainz" into solutions...
### Update #3: I was away for the weekend so I was late for days 16 and 17 challenges.. did them both today.. loved how both required insane amount of iteration but could be done in far less (looking at you day 16) :)
